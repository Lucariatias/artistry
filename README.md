Artistry
========

A graphics editor

Artistry is a basic graphics editor based on the shortcomings in common graphics editors on OS X:

* GIMP: UI is a mess, OS X version's menus are buggy
* Seashore: Window often freezes, preventing you seeing updates in real time
* Photoshop: Proprietary, Adobe-owned piece of software with a high cost and/or subscription fee

With this in mind, Artistry aims to be a responsive, powerful graphics package. (It's a long way off that for now, but we'll see how things improve ;) )
